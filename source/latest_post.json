{"title":"Canary","date":"2013-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","body":"<p>For the last few months I&rsquo;ve been working on something new. I live and work on the Internet, so it&rsquo;s very important that my various websites, web apps, and whatnots are all up and working properly. That moment when you realize that something is broken, that it&rsquo;s been that way for hours—or even longer—and you had no idea, sucks.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few different products and services that attempt to solve this problem, but they&rsquo;re either really difficult to use, ridiculously expensive, or in most cases, both. These products are all targeted at large businesses, and although I might not be large, I <em>am</em> a business. I want to know when things go wrong, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to pay $50+ a month to know it. I don&rsquo;t want to be up-sold for every basic feature. I don&rsquo;t want to wait days for help and talk to an unhelpful robot when I finally get it. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect to pay a fair amount every month for a great product made by great people. So I&rsquo;m building the product I want.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href=\"https://canaryup.com\">Canary</a>. Right now it will ping URLs and let you know when they go down and when they go back up. I&rsquo;ve teamed up with my friend and co-founder, <a href=\"http://avandamiri.com\">Avand</a>. We&rsquo;re starting small and plan to work our way up; we&rsquo;ve got some really awesome features planned.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to know when things go wrong before anyone else does, <a href=\"https://canaryup.com\">sign up for Canary</a>.</p>\n"}
